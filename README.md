Rodomatic5000
=============

The Rodomatic5000 project is designed to help graduate developers get their first experience of a Xero-style project. 
It uses basic implementations of the Xero stack to illustrate how our projects are typically built. The website displays a list of tweets from Rod.

It includes:
- WebAPI
- [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline)
- Razor
- SSDT
- [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/dapper-dot-net)
- [XUI](https://github.dev.xero.com/UXE/xui)
- [React.JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) (doesn't include build tools or ES6/7)

Read the Rodomatic5000 [Setup Guide](https://confluence.inside.xero.com/display/DEV/Rodomatic5000+Setup) to get it up and running.
The project tasks are in [JIRA](https://jira.inside.xero.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=757&projectKey=GT&view=planning&selectedIssue=GT-4).
